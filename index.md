## About Me

I'm a third-year Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en" target="_blank"> Inria</a>'s <a href="https://team.inria.fr/thoth/" target="_blank"> Thoth team</a>,
<!-- , specifically within the <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/research/sackler-institute-graduate-biomedical-sciences/" target="_blank"> Vilcek institute of Biomedical Sciences</a> and the Department of <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/" target="_blank"> Population Health</a>. Under the mentorship of Prof.  -->
working under the supervision of Dr.<a href="https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/alahari/" target="_blank"> Karteek Alahari</a>. Since May 2024, we have started a collaboration with Dr.<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahaf-aljundi/" target="_blank"> Rahaf Aljundi</a> from <a href="https://www.toyota-europe.com/" target="_blank"> Toyota Motor Europe</a> to explore Continual learning with Vision Language Models.

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I had the opportunity to work as a Research Engineer with <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en" target="_blank"> Inria</a> and <a href="https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/" target="_blank"> Meta Reality Labs </a> where I applied my skills to audio-visual speech processing. The project was under the mentorship of Dr. <a href="https://team.inria.fr/perception/team-members/radu-patrice-horaud/" target="_blank"> Radu Horaud</a> (*Inria*), Dr. <a href="https://msaadeghii.github.io/" target="_blank"> Mostafa Sadeghi</a> (*Inria*) and Dr. <a href="https://www.soundzones.com/jdonley/" target="_blank"> Jacob Donley </a> (*Meta*) and Dr. <a href="https://anuragkr90.github.io/" target="_blank"> Anurag Kumar </a> (*Meta*).

I completed my master's degree in Machine Learning and Optimization of Complex Systems from <a href="https://www.utc.fr/en/" target = "_blank"> Université de Technologie de Compiègne (Sorbonne)</a>.  I obtained my engineer's degree in Decision Data Mining from <a href="https://www.utt.fr/" target = "_blank"> Université de Technologie de Troyes</a>. 





## Research Interests
- **Continual Learning:** Lifelong knowledge acquisition in realistic scenarios such as limited labeled data (ICCV 2023), imbalanced data (IJCAI 2024), online learning with stochastic data stream (ICLR 2025), and domain generalization or post-training (ongoing work).
- **Vision-Language Learning and Reasoning:** Enhancing vision-language models' performance via in-context learning, test-time scaling, and model-based annotation (ongoing work).
- **Audio-visual Speech Processing:** Enhancing audio-visual processing with face frontalization (IJCV 2023 and ICASSP 2022).

## News
- **[2025.01]** One paper about general continual learning based on prompt initialization and output layer masking is accepted by **ICLR 2025**. Huge thanks to all my co-authors! More details to come soon.


- **[2024.04]** I will be attending <a href="https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/icvss2024/Home" target = "_blank"> ICVSS 2024 </a> summer school in Sicily. The topic of this year is *Computer Vision in the Age of Large Language Models*. Looking forward to it!

- **[2024.04]** One paper about task-imbalanced continual learning based on dynamic prompt learning is accepted by **IJCAI 2024**. Congrats to my collaborators! More details to come soon.

- **[2023.08]** One paper about semi-supervised continual learning is accepted by **ICCV 2023** and is selected as an **oral** presentation (selection rate 1.8%)!
